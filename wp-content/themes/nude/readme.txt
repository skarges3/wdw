Nude is the most beautiful theme you've never seen before.

== Description ==

Nude is a theme that is exactly that. Nude. It doesn't have any posts, menus or widgets to show you. All it has is your title, tagline and the confidence to say it's powered by WordPress. Use this if all you want is the WordPress REST API or a way of keeping things minimalistic.

= Developers =
